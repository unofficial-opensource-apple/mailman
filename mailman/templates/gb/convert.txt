The %(listname)s mailing list has just undergone a big change.  It is
running on a new mailing list package called "Mailman".  This will
hopefully solve a lot of problems that administering this list has
presented.

How does this affect you?
对您的影响 ?

1) Mail intended for the whole list should be sent to: %(listaddr)s.

2) You have been given an arbitrary password to prevent others from
unsubscribing you without your knowledge.  It will be mailed to you in 
a separate email, which you may have already received.  Don't worry if 
you forget this password; a reminder will be sent to you via email
every month.

3) If you have World Wide Web access, you can use it any time to
unsubscribe from this list, to switch to and from digest mode, to
check back issues of the list (which will be available after the list
has been getting posts for a day or so), etc.  The Web address for
these resources is:

    %(listinfo_url)s

4) 如果您不能由 WWW 存取 , 您可以通过 email 达到相同的功能 .
 email 一封标题或内文为 "help" ( 不需引号 )一个单字到
 %(requestaddr)s .您会收到自动回复的 email , 上面会有更详
细的说明 .  

Please address any questions or problems with this new setup to:
