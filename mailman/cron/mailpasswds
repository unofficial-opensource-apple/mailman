"""Send password reminders for all lists to all users.

This program scans all mailing lists and collects users and their passwords,
grouped by the list's host_name if mm_cfg.VIRTUAL_HOST_OVERVIEW is true.  Then
one email message is sent to each unique user (per-virtual host) containing
the list passwords and options url for the user.  The password reminder comes
from the mm_cfg.MAILMAN_SITE_LIST, which must exist.

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options]

Options:
    -l listname
    --listname=listname
        Send password reminders for the named list only.  If omitted,
        reminders are sent for all lists.  Multiple -l/--listname options are
        allowed.

    -h/--help
        Print this message and exit.
