There are many resources available for those who need help with
Mailman, beyond the <a href="docs.html">on-line documentation</a>.  If
you are having problems installing or configuring Mailman, or if you
have questions about what Mailman can do, you should probably start
with the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>, and the community driven
<a href="http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/faqw-mm.py">FAQ Wizard</a>.

<p>Beyond that, please use the <a href="lists.html">discussion
lists</a> for asking questions.  There are lots of very helpful and
knowledgeable people on the lists who can help.  Probably the most
helpful will be the <a href="http://listowner.org/">Listowners</a>
mailing list and the
<a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-users"
>mailman-users</a> mailing lists.
