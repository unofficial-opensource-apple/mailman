Mailman is software to help manage email discussion lists, much like
Majordomo and SmartList. Unlike most similar products, Mailman gives
each mailing list a web page, and allows users to subscribe,
unsubscribe, etc. over the web.  Even the list manager can administer
his or her list entirely from the web.  Mailman also integrates most
things people want to do with mailing lists, including archiving,
mail-to-news gateways, integrated bounce handling, spam prevention,
email-based admin commands, direct SMTP delivery (with fast bulk
mailing), support for virtual domains, and more.

<p>
Mailman runs on most Un*x-like systems, is compatible with most web
servers and browsers, and most SMTP servers.  Mailman requires
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python version 1.5 or newer</a>.
Python is a free object-oriented scripting language.  A few files are
written in C for security purposes.

<p>The manual is still only a set of READMEs provided in the Mailman
distribution.  For now, more information can be found at
<a href="http://www.list.org/">www.list.org</a>.

Lists</a></h4>

<p>
There are several mailing lists devoted to Mailman, which also provide
nice demonstrations of Mailman!

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-announce">
    Mailman Announce</a> is a read-only list that you can subscribe to 
    if you are only interested in release notices and other important
    news.  Only the core Mailman developers can post messages to this
    list.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-users">
    Mailman Users</a> is the mailing list to subscribe to if you are
    using Mailman at your site, and may have problems or questions
    relating to installation, use, etc.  We'll try to keep the deep
    technical discussions off this list.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-developers">
    Mailman Developers</a> is the mailing list to use if you are
    interested in helping us develop Mailman, discuss future
    directions, etc.  This is the list for more in-depth technical
    issues.

<p><li><a href="http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/mailman-checkins">
    Mailman Checkins</a> is an adjunct list to the publically
    accessible read-only CVS repository.  This list is for the
    hardcore developers, or anybody else submitting patches, since we
    really prefer such patches to be generated against the latest
    snapshot.  This is a read-only list; only the core Mailman
    developers can post messages to this list.  There is no archive.
