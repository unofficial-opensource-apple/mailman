"These policies control the automatic bounce processing system\n"
"            in Mailman.  Here's an overview of how it works.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>When a bounce is received, Mailman tries to extract two "
"pieces\n"
"            of information from the message: the address of the member the\n"
"            message was intended for, and the severity of the problem "
"causing\n"
"            the bounce.  The severity can be either <em>hard</em> or\n"
"            <em>soft</em> meaning either a fatal error occurred, or a\n"
"            transient error occurred.  When in doubt, a hard severity is "
"used.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>If no member address can be extracted from the bounce, then "
"the\n"
"            bounce is usually discarded.  Otherwise, each member is assigned "
"a\n"
"            <em>bounce score</em> and every time we encounter a bounce from\n"
"            this member we increment the score.  Hard bounces increment by "
"1\n"
"            while soft bounces increment by 0.5.  We only increment the "
"bounce\n"
"            score once per day, so even if we receive ten hard bounces from "
"a\n"
"            member per day, their score will increase by only 1 for that "
"day.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>When a member's bounce score is greater than the\n"
"            <a href=\"?VARHELP=bounce/bounce_score_threshold\">bounce score\n"
"            threshold</a>, the subscription is disabled.  Once disabled, "
"the\n"
"            member will not receive any postings from the list until their\n"
"            membership is explicitly re-enabled (either by the list\n"
"            administrator or the user).  However, they will receive "
"occasional\n"
"            reminders that their membership has been disabled, and these\n"
"            reminders will include information about how to re-enable their\n"
"            membership.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>You can control both the\n"
"            <a href=\"?VARHELP=bounce/bounce_you_are_disabled_warnings"

"            >frequency</a> with which these reminders are sent.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>There is one other important configuration variable; after a\n"
"            certain period of time -- during which no bounces from the "
"member\n"

"Primary start-up and shutdown script for Mailman's qrunner daemon.\n"
"\n"
"This script starts, stops, and restarts the main Mailman queue runners, "
"making\n"
"sure that the various long-running sub-qrunners are still alive and "
"kicking.\n"
"It does this by forking and exec'ing the sub-qrunners and waiting on their\n"
"pids.  When it detects a subprocess has exited, it may restart it.\n"
"\n"
"The sub-qrunners respond to SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGHUP.  SIGINT and "
"SIGTERM\n"
"both cause the sub-qrunners to exit cleanly, but the master will only "
"restart\n"
"sub-qrunners that have exited due to a SIGINT.  SIGHUP causes the master\n"
"qrunner and sub-qrunners to close their log files, and reopen then upon the\n"
"next printed message.\n"
"\n"
"The master qrunner also responds to SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGHUP, which it\n"
"simply passes on to the sub-qrunners (note that the master will close and\n"
"reopen its own log files on receipt of a SIGHUP).  The master qrunner also\n"
"leaves its own process id in the file data/master-qrunner.pid but you "
"normally\n"
"don't need to use this pid directly.  The `start', `stop', `restart', and\n"
"`open' commands handle everything for you.\n"
"\n"
"Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [options] [ start | stop | restart | reopen ]\n"
"\n"
"Options:\n"
"\n"
"    -n/--no-restart\n"
"        Don't restart the sub-qrunners when they exit because of an error or "
"a\n"
"        SIGINT (they are never restarted if they exit in response to a\n"
"        SIGTERM).  Use this only for debugging.  Only useful if the `start'\n"
"        command is given.\n"
"\n"
"    -u/--run-as-user\n"
"        Normally, this script will refuse to run if the user id and group "
"id\n"
"        are not set to the `mailman' user and group (as defined when you\n"
"        configured Mailman).  If run as root, this script will change to "
"this\n"
"        user and group before the check is made.\n"
"\n"
"        This can be inconvenient for testing and debugging purposes, so the -"
"u\n"
"        flag means that the step that sets and checks the uid/gid is "
"skipped,\n"
"        and the program is run as the current user and group.  This flag is\n"
"        not recommended for normal production environments.\n"
"\n"
"    -s/--stale-lock-cleanup\n"
"        If mailmanctl finds an existing master qrunner lock, it will "
"normally\n"
"        exit with an error message.  With this optionn, mailmanctl will "
"perform\n"
"        an extra level of checking.  If a process matching the host/pid\n"

"\n"
"    stop    - Stops the master qrunner daemon and all sub-qrunners.  After\n"
"              stopping, no more messages will be processed.\n"
"\n"
"    restart - Restarts the sub-qrunners, but not the master qrunner.  This "

"              really handy for development because without restarting, the\n"
"              sub-qrunners won't reload any changed modules.\n"

"General framework for interacting with a mailing list object.\n"
"\n"
"There are two ways to use this script: interactively or programmatically.\n"
"Using it interactively allows you to play with, examine and modify a "
"MailList\n"
"object from Python's interactive interpreter.  When running interactively, "
"a\n"
"MailList object called `m' will be available in the global namespace.  It "
"also\n"
"loads the class MailList into the global namespace.\n"
"\n"
"Programmatically, you can write a function to operate on a MailList object,\n"
"and this script will take care of the housekeeping (see below for "
"examples).\n"
"In that case, the general usage syntax is:\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist [options] listname [args ...]\n"
"\n"
"Options:\n"
"\n"
"    -l / --lock\n"
"        Lock the list when opening.  Normally the list is opened unlocked\n"
"        (e.g. for read-only operations).  You can always lock the file "
"after\n"
"        the fact by typing `m.Lock()'\n"
"\n"
"        Note that if you use this option, you should explicitly call m.Save"
"()\n"
"        before exiting, since the interpreter's clean up procedure will not\n"
"        automatically save changes to the MailList object (but it will "
"unlock\n"
"        the list).\n"
"\n"
"    -i / --interactive\n"
"        Leaves you at an interactive prompt after all other processing is\n"
"        complete.  This is the default unless the -r option is given.\n"
"\n"
"    --run [module.]callable\n"
"    -r [module.]callable\n"
"        This can be used to run a script with the opened MailList object.\n"
"        This works by attempting to import `module' (which must already be\n"
"        accessible on your sys.path), and then calling `callable' from the\n"
"        module.  callable can be a class or function; it is called with the\n"
"        MailList object as the first argument.  If additional args are "
"given\n"
"        on the command line, they are passed as subsequent positional args "
"to\n"
"        the callable.\n"
"\n"
"        Note that `module.' is optional; if it is omitted then a module "
"with\n"
"        the name `callable' will be imported.\n"
"\n"
"        The global variable `r' will be set to the results of this call.\n"
"\n"
"    --all / -a\n"
"        This option only works with the -r option.  Use this if you want to\n"
"        execute the script on all mailing lists.  When you use -a you "
"should\n"
"        not include a listname argument on the command line.  The variable "
"`r'\n"
"        will be a list of all the results.\n"
"\n"
"    --quiet / -q\n"
"        Suppress all status messages.\n"
"\n"
"    --help / -h\n"
"        Print this message and exit\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Here's an example of how to use the -r option.  Say you have a file in the\n"
"Mailman installation directory called `listaddr.py', with the following\n"
"two functions:\n"
"\n"
"def listaddr(mlist):\n"
"    print mlist.GetListEmail()\n"
"\n"
"def requestaddr(mlist):\n"
"    print mlist.GetRequestEmail()\n"
"\n"
"Now, from the command line you can print the list's posting address by "
"running\n"
"the following from the command line:\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist -r listaddr mylist\n"
"Loading list: mylist (unlocked)\n"
"Importing listaddr ...\n"
"Running listaddr.listaddr() ...\n"
"mylist@myhost.com\n"
"\n"
"And you can print the list's request address by running:\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist -r listaddr.requestaddr mylist\n"
"Loading list: mylist (unlocked)\n"
"Importing listaddr ...\n"
"Running listaddr.requestaddr() ...\n"
"mylist-request@myhost.com\n"
"\n"
"As another example, say you wanted to change the password for a particular\n"
"user on a particular list.  You could put the following function in a file\n"
"called `changepw.py':\n"
"\n"
"from Mailman.Errors import NotAMember\n"
"\n"
"def changepw(mlist, addr, newpasswd):\n"
"    try:\n"
"        mlist.setMemberPassword(addr, newpasswd)\n"
"        mlist.Save()\n"
"    except NotAMember:\n"
"        print 'No address matched:', addr\n"
