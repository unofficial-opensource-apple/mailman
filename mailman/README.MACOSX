MacOSX ISSUES

    Mailman should run on MacOSX, although I have not personally had
    time to try it yet.  Here are some pointers we've collected on
    getting Mailman to run on MacOSX.

    - Jaguar (MacOSX 10.2) comes with Python 2.2.  While this isn't
      the very latest stable version of Python, it ought to be
      sufficient to run Mailman 2.1.

    - David B. O'Donnell has a web page describing his configuration
      of Mailman 2.0.13 and Postfix on MacOSX Server.

    - Kathleen Webb posted her experiences in getting Mailman running
      on Jaguar using Sendmail.
