The file published.ps is (nearly) the PostScript of the paper
published in Usenix LISA 98, Dec 6-11 1998, Boston MA.  John Viega
presented this paper on Dec 11, 1998.

I say "nearly" because there was one minor typo in this file that was
corrected in the final published version.  Footnote 3 (page 312)
should read:

    This file may in fact reside in other locations, depending on the 
    system.  For example, on many Solaris machines this file is
    located in /etc/mail/aliases.
