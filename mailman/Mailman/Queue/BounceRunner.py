        # Registering a bounce means acquiring the list lock, and it would be
        # too expensive to do this for each message.  Instead, each bounce
        # runner maintains an event log which is essentially a file with
        # multiple pickles.  Each bounce we receive gets appended to this file
        # as a 4-tuple record: (listname, addr, today, msg)
        #
        # today is itself a 3-tuple of (year, month, day)
        #
        # Every once in a while (see _doperiodic()), the bounce runner cracks
        # open the file, reads all the records and registers all the bounces.
        # Then it truncates the file and continues on.  We don't need to lock
        # the bounce event file because bounce qrunners are single threaded
        # and each creates a uniquely named file to contain the events.

        # XXX When Python 2.3 is minimal require, we can use the new
        # tempfile.TemporaryFile() function.
        #
        # XXX We used to classify bounces to the site list as bounce events
        # for every list, but this caused severe problems.  Here's the
        # scenario: aperson@example.com is a member of 4 lists, and a list
        # owner of the foo list.  example.com has an aggressive spam filter
        # which rejects any message that is spam or contains spam as an
        # attachment.  Now, a spambot sends a piece of spam to the foo list,
        # but since that spambot is not a member, the list holds the message
        # for approval, and sends a notification to aperson@example.com as
        # list owner.  That notification contains a copy of the spam.  Now
        # example.com rejects the message, causing a bounce to be sent to the
        # site list's bounce address.  The bounce runner would then dutifully
        # register a bounce for all 4 lists that aperson@example.com was a
        # member of, and eventually that person would get disabled on all
        # their lists.  So now we ignore site list bounces.  Ce La Vie for
